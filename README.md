### [Prograchallenges.com](https://prograchallenges.com) is thankful to [Talentrator](https://talentrator.com/) who are funding this project, 
We enable companies in the Nordic to supercharge their growth by securely hiring the best international software developers. We strongly believe there are many talented developers around the world, eager to work on something meaningful but can't find the right opportunities and have few ways of qualifying themselves. We pledge to find them, test them and allow them to accelerate their careers by working remotely at Nordic software companies.
